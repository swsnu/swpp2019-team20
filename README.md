# Customer

In a group of two or more people who engage in economic activities, everyone can be an appropriate customer of this service. This service is useful in all the various group activities where payments occur, such as borrowing money from close friends, dutch after meals with colleagues in a restaurant, company meetings, and club trips. Since these transactions frequently occur, there are many inconveniences in managing money, such as complicated relationships between borrowing and paying back. The money problem among people is quite stressful because people often forget about debt or find it difficult to calculate when multiple payers exist for multiple times. While calculating and urging people to pay you off, you may waste time and emotions.

Since these problems destroy mutual relationships by making people lose trust with each other, customers have a desire for services that solve these problems on their behalf. We offer a convenient solution to customers who are tired of these debt problems. More specifically, (1) fast and automatic calculations through an intuitive UI and simple upload of receipt, (2) appropriately frequent notifications so that no one loses money or trust, and (3) blame or praise the debtor (4) prediction the date when all debts will be repaid. If you need one or more of these functions, you are the right customer of this service.

# Competitive Landscape

The current mobile application <Dutch: Dutch Pay Calculator>â€™s purpose is to make people's Dutch pay process easier. However, this application only has the functionality of a simple calculator. In order to use this calculator, a user has to input the price at first hand. Also, because they do not store user data, each time a new transaction is registered, meaningless arbitrary names have to be given to derive the result. It is also the creditor's task to tell the borrowers how much to pay back. In order to notify the payment information and debt facts to borrowers, although this is not a formal service, people use KakaoTalk group chat a lot. After the lender invites borrowers in group chat, the lender tells how much each person should repay. Invited people send money and leave the group chat. This approach allows people to know who hasn't sent money yet and to give some force. However, people forget the fact that there was such a chat over time, and some people do not leave the chat even after paying back the money, so there is a lack of force.

Our service is different from the existing service mentioned above in the following strengths. First, by easy searching and clicking the participants and uploading a receipt photo, our ML feature automatically calculates who should send how much money to whom and analyzes what kinds of consumption is. For example, the calculation of the _Many to Many for K_ times transaction relationship can be conveniently calculated, and the paying off process can be easily performed due to maintaining a database for users. Second, because there exists a mutual credit evaluation system, every user can see the credit scores and comments of others through the profile page, so that borrowers are forced to repay before the deadline. Third, there are appropriately frequent notifications proportional to the user's credit and deadline. This frequency is also automatically calculated. Last, users can easily keep track of the whole list of what they ought to pay and what they need to get. Users also can catch their consumption patterns, make sure the process of paying back is well, predict the probability of repaying a loan. By using user information, this service shows how capable a borrower is of repaying a debt. In addition, there is a review filtering function through sentiment analysis. Users can use the filtering function to see only positive or negative reviews.
